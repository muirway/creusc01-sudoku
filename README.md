# creusc01-sudoku
Sudoku assignment as part of PP&amp;L

* General info:
Student name: Christian Reusch
Moodle name: creusc01

* Disclaimer: 

- This work is my own. 
- The neat trick of defining the iterator that pops up all over the place in the code is NOT my original invention. I found that in a Stackexchange group and have liberally exploited it for my own purposes. 

* Notes: 

- I have googled around heavily to find a way into the problem.
- The code is a mixture of tips and tricks found and the web as well as my own toiling.
- I have not found time to test the code.
