- This is the repo for the Racket sudoku project
- I have googled around heavily to find a way into the problem
- The code is a mixture of tips and tricks found and the web as well as my own toiling
- Disclaimer: The neat trick of defining the iterator that pops up all over the place in the code is NOT my original invention. I found that in a Stackexchange group and have liberally exploited it for my own purposes.
